# Planet Detroit Environmental Dashboard

## Summary
The "Planet Detroit Environmental Dashboard" project aims to develop a centralized platform that provides accessible environmental and public health information to residents of southeast Michigan. Despite the availability of data sources such as Air Quality Index (AQI) and Climate Shift Index, the project team faced challenges in sourcing granular data for environmental risk factors (fire, flood, heat, and wind).

The scope of work includes researching and compiling relevant environmental data sources, designing an interactive prototype of the dashboard that displays these data, and developing a comprehensive strategy for implementation. The project requires proficiency in data analysis, visualization, web development, environmental science, public health, UI/UX design, and API integration.

## Objective
The initial phase focused on laying the groundwork for the project by understanding the scope, identifying key deliverables, and determining the necessary resources and technology packages required for implementation.

## Key Activities
- Problem Identification: Through discussions with clients and stakeholders, we identified the need for a platform that simplifies access to environmental data for the public.
- Deliverables Specification: Final deliverables were outlined, including an interactive web dashboard with features focusing on air and water quality, environmental hazards, recreational access, and habitat health.
- Data and Resources Assessment: We identified the data required for the interactive visualizations and assessed the availability of these resources. A gap analysis was performed to highlight missing data and potential sources.
- Technology Research: Research was conducted on UI and Data Visualization libraries, API endpoints, and other technology packages suitable for the project's needs.
- Environmental Research: Comprehensive research on air and water quality, environmental hazards, recreational access, and habitat health was undertaken to inform the project's content and structure.
